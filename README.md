Android application to ping a user's location on the map using the ``Google Places API`` and the ``Google LocationServices API``.
Great tutorial if you are planning to integrate location services into your app.

- **NB:** Use your own API KEY if you decide to use the code, insert it in the ``gradle.properties`` file under ``GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY``.
